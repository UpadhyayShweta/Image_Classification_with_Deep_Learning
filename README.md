# Image Classification with Deep Learning

In this notebook, we'll be attempting to classify images of Natural Scenes around the world, using _Convolutional Neural Network_ with _Keras_. To approach this we'll build a simple sequential model first and another model using transfer learning from a pre-trained network(VGG16) and then compare the performance of both the models.
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs breaks down the image or input into smaller, simpler features, which are represented by filters. These filters are applied to different regions of the input to extract the relevant information. As the network progresses through the layers, these features are combined and assembled into more complex patterns, allowing the network to learn increasingly abstract representations of the input. This hierarchical approach allows CNNs to efficiently learn complex patterns in data, while minimizing the risk of overfitting.
